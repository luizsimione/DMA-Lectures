    "From the docs:\n",
    "When you call a generator function, it doesnâ€™t return a single value; instead it returns a generator object that supports the iterator protocol.\n",
    "So... a generator object is an iterator; it implements both __iter__ and __next__ (but an iterator is not always necessarily a generator)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators and Iterators Continued\n",
    "So, when you call a generator function, you immediately get a generator object back, but the function body itself is not yet executed. The generator object returned behaves like an iterator:\n",
    "\n",
    "it has a __next__ method\n",
    "...so that means you can pass the generator object into the next function, similar to iterable objects returning iterators\n",
    "using next controls the function's execution; it starts or resumes the function until yield is encountered\n",
    "at which point a value is returned and execution is temporarily suspended."
